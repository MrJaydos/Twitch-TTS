# Twitch TTS

Self-hosted, multi-user **Text-to-Speech browser source** for Twitch streamers.

Each streamer logs in with Twitch, points the app at a channel, tunes their voice
and filters from a web dashboard, and drops a personal **Browser Source URL** into
OBS. The server reads chat, generates speech with [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl)
(fully self-hosted — no per-word API costs), and streams the audio to the overlay.

- **TTS engine:** Piper, running in Docker. No cloud keys, no usage fees.
- **Trigger:** Twitch chat messages (all messages, or only a `!command` prefix).
- **Multi-user:** anyone can log in with Twitch and run their own overlay.
- **Deploy:** Docker Compose, built for Coolify auto-deploy from GitHub.

## How it works

```
Streamer → Dashboard (login with Twitch) → configures channel/voice/filters
        → copies their Browser Source URL
OBS Browser Source  ──ws──►  app
app reads chat anonymously (justinfan, no token needed)
   → applies the streamer's filters
   → Piper synthesizes a WAV  →  app streams a "play" event to the overlay
Overlay plays audio in order (+ optional on-screen captions)
```

Three containers:

| Service    | Role                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app`      | Node/Fastify: dashboard, overlay, API, WebSockets, chat reader, TTS queue |
| `piper`    | Piper HTTP server; synthesizes speech. Voices persist on a volume.      |
| `postgres` | User accounts + settings.                                               |

> **Why server-side audio?** OBS browser sources run an embedded Chromium that
> usually has **no** speech-synthesis voices, so the browser's `speechSynthesis`
> can't be relied on. The server generates the audio; the overlay only plays it.

## 1. Register a Twitch application

1. Go to <https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps> → **Register Your Application**.
2. **OAuth Redirect URL** must be exactly:
   `https://twitchtts.alfi3.com/auth/twitch/callback`
   (for local testing: `http://localhost:3000/auth/twitch/callback`)
3. Category: *Website Integration*. Create it, then copy the **Client ID** and
   generate a **Client Secret**.

You can add more redirect URLs later (e.g. one for local dev and one for prod).

---

## 2. Deploy on Coolify (recommended)

Coolify watches your GitHub repo and rebuilds on every push.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Coolify: **New Resource → Docker Compose**, and select your repo/branch.
   Coolify installs a GitHub webhook so every push redeploys automatically.
3. Set a **Domain** for the `app` service (Coolify's proxy terminates TLS).
4. Add these **Environment Variables** in Coolify (→ your resource → Environment
   Variables). All five are **required** — Coolify injects them into the container:

   | Variable               | Value                                                    |
   | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `PUBLIC_URL`           | `https://twitchtts.alfi3.com` (no trailing slash)        |
   | `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`     | from step 1                                               |
   | `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` | from step 1                                               |
   | `SESSION_SECRET`       | long random string — `openssl rand -hex 32`              |
   | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`    | a strong password (Postgres won't start without it)      |

   `DATABASE_URL` is derived automatically from `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` at boot, and
   `PIPER_URL` / voices are preset in the compose file. To change voices, edit
   `DEFAULT_VOICE` / `PIPER_VOICES` in `docker-compose.yaml`.

5. Deploy. First boot downloads the Piper voices into the `piper-voices` volume
   (this can take a minute). `postgres-data`, `piper-voices`, and `audio-cache`
   persist across redeploys.

Open `https://twitchtts.alfi3.com` and log in with Twitch.

---

## 3. Run locally with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in TWITCH_* and SESSION_SECRET
docker compose up --build
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000>. For local login, set the Twitch redirect URL to
`http://localhost:3000/auth/twitch/callback` and `PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 4. Add the overlay to OBS

1. In the dashboard, copy your **Browser Source URL** (`…/overlay?token=…`).
2. OBS → **Sources → + → Browser**.
3. Paste the URL. Size doesn't matter (audio-only unless captions are on; a
   common choice is 1920×1080).
4. Tick **Control audio via OBS** so the TTS routes through your OBS audio mixer.
5. Click **Speak** on the dashboard to test — you should hear it in OBS.

> Keep the URL private. Anyone who has it can play audio through your overlay.
> Use **Regenerate** in the dashboard to invalidate the old URL.

## Settings reference

| Setting                | What it does                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled                | Master on/off for reading chat.                                    |
| Twitch channel         | Which channel's chat to read (defaults to your own).              |
| Voice                  | Piper voice. The list comes from `PIPER_VOICES`.                  |
| Trigger                | Read every message, or only messages starting with a prefix.      |
| Prefix                 | The command prefix (e.g. `!tts`) when trigger = prefix.           |
| Who can trigger        | everyone / subscribers+ / VIPs+ / moderators only.                |
| Per-user cooldown      | Minimum seconds between messages **from the same chatter**.       |
| Speed / Volume         | Playback rate and overlay volume.                                 |
| Max message length     | Longer messages are truncated.                                    |
| Blocked words          | Skip the message, or censor the words with `***`.                 |
| Ignored users          | Never read these logins (useful for chat bots).                   |
| Read the username      | Prefix speech with “Name says: …”.                                |
| Skip links / emotes    | Strip URLs / emotes before speaking.                              |
| On-screen captions     | Show who said what as a caption on the overlay.                   |

Dashboard controls: **Speak** (test message), **Skip current**, **Clear queue**,
and a live **Activity** feed of what's being read.

## Adding more voices

Browse voices at <https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices>. Add their names
(e.g. `en_US-hfc_female-medium`) to `PIPER_VOICES`, comma-separated, and redeploy.
The `piper` service downloads any that are missing on boot.

---

## Verifying a deploy

- **Health:** `GET https://twitchtts.alfi3.com/healthz` → `{"ok":true,"piper":true}`.
  `piper:false` means the piper service isn't reachable/ready yet.
- **TTS path:** open the overlay URL in a normal browser tab (click once to allow
  audio), then hit **Speak** on the dashboard → you hear it.
- **Live chat:** type in the configured channel's chat → it's read aloud, and the
  message shows in the dashboard's Activity feed.
- **Filters:** flip to prefix mode / raise the role gate / add a blocked word and
  confirm messages are gated as expected.
- **Multi-user:** log in from a second Twitch account → separate token, separate
  channel, fully independent.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`P1000: Authentication failed against database server`** — Postgres sets its
  password only on **first init**. If the `postgres-data` volume was created with a
  different password, changing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` later won't take effect. Stop the
  stack, delete the `postgres-data` volume (Coolify → Storages, or
  `docker volume rm <name>`), then redeploy. Safe if you have no real data yet.
- **`Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`** — make sure `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  is set in Coolify's Environment Variables. `DATABASE_URL` is derived from it at boot.
- **`/healthz` shows `"piper": false`** — the piper service is still downloading
  voices on first boot (can take a minute) or hasn't started yet. Give it a moment.

## Local development (without Docker)

Requires Node 20+ and a reachable Postgres and Piper server.

```bash
npm install
npx prisma db push          # create tables (needs DATABASE_URL)
npm run dev                 # tsx watch on src/server.ts
```

Point `PIPER_URL` at a running Piper HTTP server and `DATABASE_URL` at Postgres.
The dashboard and overlay are plain static files under `public/`, served by the
app — no separate frontend build step.

## Tech notes

- Chat is read **anonymously** over `wss://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv` using a
  `justinfan` nick — no chat token or scopes required. Twitch OAuth is only used
  to identify the streamer at login.
- Audio is cached by content hash under `AUDIO_CACHE_DIR` and garbage-collected
  after `AUDIO_TTL_SECONDS`.
- One anonymous IRC connection serves all active channels (join/part as overlays
  connect and disconnect).
